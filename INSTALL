	Installation notes for Flick 0.0x

Installation of Flick is very simple, a "make" should compile the
sources without problems and create the file 'flick.img'. This
kernel _must_ be loaded by GRUB (http://www. gnu.org/software/grub/).
The easiest way to run Flick is to copy the kernel onto a floppy disk ("make install").

If you have problems with the installation, please write a bug report to
Alexander.Blessing@epost.de.
