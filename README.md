This is a toy operating system that I had been working on when I was about 13 years old. 
I decided to move the code from Sourceforge to Github. The original homepage was http://flick.sourceforge.net.

WHAT IS FLICK?

 Flick is an Operating System for the Personal Computer written by 
 Alexander Blessing. The aim of this project is to create a clean, 
 small and free kernel. 
 
 Flick is distributed under the GNU General Public License. 

WHICH HARDWARE DOES IT SUPPORT?
 
 Flick was developed for i386/i486-based PCs. It is unknown if it
 also runs under other hardware - this couldn't be tested, yet.

WHY SHOULD I USE FLICK?

 You shouldn't. Well, at least you needn't. It is thought as a help
 for other developers. Flick wasn't designed for beeing a high modern
 and feature-heavy Operating System, it was and is built just for fun.

HOW CAN I INSTALL FLICK?

 Read the INSTALL file which will contain the installation notes
 Note that Flick can only be run using the bootloader GRUB
